# PredictAssetsML

The PredictAssetsML project aims to predict the trajectory of an asset (currently, the target in the code is IBOV, but it can be adjusted for any other asset) by leveraging the performance over the past 6, 12, and 18 months of both the asset itself and other assets.

The predictions are generated using ML.NET, with both Sdca and Random Forest algorithms employed.
